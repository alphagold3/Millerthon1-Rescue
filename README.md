# Millerthon1-Rescue
Millerthon 1 - Rescue Project

The Millerthon is a small hackathon/game jam that my wife and I are running out of our house with some local coworkers and friends. 
Today is our first event and this is our first project.

Rescue is the code name for this project, not an actual name for the final project.
The topic for this event is animal adoption. There are too many animals needing adoption and not enough people adopting them. So our goal was to try and come up with a solution to this problem. After some discussion, the decision was made to create a website that provides a means for shelters to list their pets that are up for adoption and/or fostering and for people to find a pet to adopt and/or foster. In addition to that, the goal is to use the onboarding process to help simplify the process of actually doing the adoption and/or fostering.
